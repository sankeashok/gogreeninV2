I hope you ve the project in context.

---

Yes, I have the project context from the README. I can see this is an EDI file download automation project (EDI_File_download_All_V6) that:

- Downloads .EDI files from multiple SFTP servers
- Uses different credentials and remote paths
- Organizes files by date (YYYY-MM-DD folders)
- Avoids re-downloading existing files
- Uses Python with virtual environment setup

The main script is `EDI_File_download_All_V6.py` and it saves files to `EDI_files_TST/YYYY-MM-DD/` directories.

What would you like me to help you with regarding this project?

I'll explore the GGI_Prod project structure to understand it.

and now that the website has got a good dkeleton and content to be placed henceforth (for backdated events &amp; rides), nso as this website do not contain the 100% information I feel its better to display a flash messsage on top left corner that &#39;This website is under costruction&#39;

---

I'll add a minimal "under construction" flash message to the top left corner of the website.

---

Adding a minimal under construction flash message to the top left corner

---

Adding CSS styles for the under construction flash message with animation

---

Adding CSS styles for the under construction flash message at the beginning of the stylesheet

---

Done! I've added a minimal "under construction" flash message to the top left corner of the website. The message:

- **Position**: Fixed at top-left (10px from top and left)
- **Style**: Orange background (#ff6b35) with white text
- **Animation**: Subtle flashing effect that pulses every 2 seconds
- **Z-index**: 9999 to ensure it appears above all other content
- **Size**: Small and unobtrusive (12px font, compact padding)

The flash message will now appear on the website indicating that it's under construction while you continue adding backdated events and rides content.

study the  project ( my website)  : C:\Users\ASanke\Documents\AKS\GGI_Prod

and lets add ride 3 under 2026 : Ride03 - 18-Jan-2025 -  KBDA Cycle Ride - Powered by HCL Cyclothon

---

I'll add Ride03 to the 2026 data structure. Let me first check the existing structure.

---

The folder exists but is empty. Let me add the ride entry to the events.json file:

---

Adding Ride 2 and Ride 3 to the January 2026 events and updating ride count to 3

---


Done! I've added Ride03 to the 2026 January events. The changes include:

- Updated ride count from 1 to 3
- Added Ride 2 (gogreenin.org website launch day) with all its photos
- Added Ride 3 (KBDA Cycle Ride - Powered by HCL Cyclothon)

The Ride 3 entry is ready for photos/videos to be added to the folder when available.

---

add the images, videos and youtube link https://youtube.com/shorts/t1ylrrnwlGQ to ride 3

also add youtube link : https://youtube.com/shorts/FceLuIk_1n4

to Ride 2 - www.GoGreenin.org website launch day

---

Adding YouTube links to Ride 2 and Ride 3, and adding all photos and videos to Ride 3

---


Done! I've updated the events.json file with:

**Ride 2 (gogreenin.org website launch day):**
- Added YouTube link: https://youtube.com/shorts/FceLuIk_1n4

**Ride 3 (KBDA Cycle Ride - Powered by HCL Cyclothon):**
- Added YouTube link: https://youtube.com/shorts/t1ylrrnwlGQ
- Added 8 photos (IMG-20260118-WA0003.jpg through IMG-20260118-WA0041.jpg)
- Added 5 videos (VID-20260119-WA0020.mp4 through VID-20260119-WA0033.mp4)

---

can&#39;t see the images, videos and link in file:///C:/Users/ASanke/Documents/AKS/GGI_Prod/index.html

---

Let me check how the website loads and displays the events data.

---

I can see the issue. The website uses hardcoded data in the JavaScript file (`yearData` object) instead of loading from the `events.json` file. I need to update the JavaScript to include Ride 2 and Ride 3 data for 2026.

---

Adding Ride 3 with YouTube link, photos, and videos to the 2026 January data, and adding YouTube link to Ride 2

---


Done! I've updated the JavaScript file with:

**Ride 3 (KBDA Cycle Ride - Powered by HCL Cyclothon):**
- YouTube link: https://youtube.com/shorts/t1ylrrnwlGQ
- 8 photos
- 5 videos

**Ride 2 (www.GoGreenin.org website launch day):**
- YouTube link: https://youtube.com/shorts/FceLuIk_1n4

**Updated January 2026:**
- Ride count changed from 2 to 3

Now when you open the website and click on year 2026, you'll see all 3 rides with their photos, videos, and YouTube links in the modal popup.

Is there a way to display the latest ride details to be updated automatically on section &#39;LATEST UPDATES&#39; ,  I&#39;ll be adding the ride details in future like ride 3 added now in Jan 2026  - so this should be automaticaly displayed in LATEST UPDATES

---

I'll create a function to automatically display the latest ride from the yearData in the LATEST UPDATES section.

---

Now I'll add a function to automatically load the latest ride from yearData into the LATEST UPDATES section:

---

Adding automatic latest ride loading function that reads from yearData and updates the LATEST UPDATES section

---


Done! I've added an automatic function that:

1. **Automatically loads the latest ride** from `yearData` when the page loads
2. **Finds the most recent year** with event data (2026 currently)
3. **Extracts the first event** from the first month with data
4. **Updates the LATEST UPDATES section** with:
   - Event name
   - Month, year, and cyclist count
   - Up to 6 photos from the event
   - Proper click handlers to open the year modal

**How it works:**
- When you add new rides to `yearData` in the JavaScript file (like Ride 3 you just added), the LATEST UPDATES section will automatically display the newest ride
- It searches from the most recent year backwards
- Takes the first event from the first month that has events
- No manual HTML updates needed - just update the `yearData` object

Now whenever you add a new ride to the `yearData` object in the JavaScript file, it will automatically appear in the LATEST UPDATES section!

---

can you suggest a meaningfull comit message

---


```
Production copy1.12 - auto-load latest ride in LATEST UPDATES section
```

or

```
Production copy1.12 - dynamic latest ride display from yearData
```

---

lets push this to remote.

---

Adding all changes, committing with the message, and pushing to remote repository

---

shell

---


Successfully pushed! The changes have been committed with the message "Production copy1.12 - auto-load latest ride in LATEST UPDATES section" and pushed to GitHub. 

The commit includes:
- 1 file changed with 66 insertions
- Automatic latest ride loading functionality

Now the LATEST UPDATES section will automatically display the newest ride from your yearData whenever you add new rides!

I was thinking for an alternative to place media (images,videos) in some free storage places as keeping the media in folders within the github will increase directory size and may face limitations in future so to avoid this what best we can do ?

---


Great thinking! Here are the best free storage alternatives for your media:

## Best Options:

### 1. **Google Drive** (Recommended)
- **Free**: 15GB
- **Pros**: Easy sharing, reliable, you already use it
- **How**: Upload images → Get shareable link → Use direct image URL
- **URL format**: `https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=FILE_ID`

### 2. **Cloudinary**
- **Free**: 25GB storage, 25GB bandwidth/month
- **Pros**: Built for images/videos, automatic optimization, CDN
- **Best for**: Image hosting with transformations
- **URL**: Direct CDN links

### 3. **ImgBB**
- **Free**: Unlimited storage
- **Pros**: Simple, direct image links, no account needed
- **Cons**: Only images, not videos

### 4. **GitHub Releases**
- **Free**: Part of your repo but separate from main code
- **Pros**: Same platform, version control
- **Cons**: Still counts toward repo size

### 5. **Imgur**
- **Free**: Unlimited images
- **Pros**: Fast, reliable, direct links
- **Cons**: Only images, may compress quality

## My Recommendation:

**Use Google Drive** since:
- You already have the 17th Anniversary photos there
- 15GB free is plenty
- Easy to organize by year/month
- Can share entire folders
- Reliable and permanent

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Instead of:
photos: ['data/2026/01-January/Ride03/IMG-001.jpg']

// Use:
photos: ['https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=YOUR_FILE_ID']
```

**Or use Cloudinary** for better performance:
- Automatic image optimization
- Responsive images
- Video hosting included
- Free tier is generous

Would you like me to help you migrate to one of these solutions?
